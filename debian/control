Description: FreNaP is a Frequency-based Navigation Prediction tool. It uses the Frequency Map Enhancement to find reoccuring patterns in navigation statistics gathered in topological maps. The FreNaP can be used to predict if a particular edge of a topological edge is going to be traversable at a given time and it also attemprs to estimate how long the traversal is going to take.
