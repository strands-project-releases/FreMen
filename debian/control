Description: The FrOctoMap (Frequency Enhanced OctoMap) method allows for efficient volumetric representation of dynamic three-dimensional environments over long periods of time. It is based on combination of a well-established 3D mapping framework called Octomaps and an idea to model environment dynamics by its frequency spectrum (FreMeN) [3]. The proposed method allows not only for efficient representation, but also reliable prediction of the future states of dynamic three-dimensional environments.
